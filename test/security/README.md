## üéØ ATTACK SIMULATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: JWT Algorithm Confusion Attack

```typescript
// Simulates attacker switching JWT algorithm from RS256 to HS256
const maliciousToken = switchJWTAlgorithm(validToken, 'HS256');
// Test verifies this attack is blocked
```

### Example 2: Multi-Tenant Data Access Attack

```typescript
// Company A admin tries to access Company B data
const crossTenantAttack = await service.getEffectivePermissionsForUser(
  'company-a-admin', 
  'company-b' // Wrong company
);
// Should be rejected with appropriate error
```

### Example 3: SQL Injection in Permission Names

```typescript
// Attempts SQL injection through permission parameter
const sqlInjectionPayload = "'; DROP TABLE permissions; --";
const result = await service.hasPermission({
  user_id: 'user-123',
  permission_name: sqlInjectionPayload,
  company_id: 'company-456'
});
// Should safely handle malicious input
```

### Example 4: Attorney-Client Privilege Violation

```typescript
// Attorney A tries to access Attorney B's confidential client data
const privilegeViolation = await service.hasPermission({
  user_id: 'attorney-a',
  permission_name: 'ACCESS_ATTORNEY_B_CLIENT_CONFIDENTIAL',
  company_id: 'law-firm'
});
// Should be denied to maintain attorney-client privilege
```
