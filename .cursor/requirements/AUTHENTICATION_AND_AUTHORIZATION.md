**Module: Authentication & Authorization Foundational Requirements**

**REQ-AUTH-001**

- **Requirement Type:** Security, API
- **Description:** The system MUST use Auth0 for user authentication. Client applications MUST integrate with Auth0 using the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).
- **Rationale:** Leverages a specialized third-party identity provider for robust authentication, offloading complexity. PKCE is the current best practice for native and web apps to prevent authorization code interception.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Users are redirected to Auth0 for login/signup.
  - Successful authentication results in the client receiving an ID Token and an Access Token from Auth0.
  - The client securely stores the tokens according to platform best practices.
-
- **Priority:** Must Have
- **Standard/Reference:** OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, PKCE RFC 7636, Auth0 Documentation

**REQ-AUTH-002**

- **Requirement Type:** Security, API
- **Description:** All API endpoints under the /v1/ path prefix (except potentially a public health check endpoint like /health) MUST be protected and require a valid Auth0 Access Token (JWT) presented in the Authorization: Bearer \<token\> HTTP header. The backend server MUST validate the JWT signature, issuer, audience, and expiration.
- **Rationale:** Ensures only authenticated users can interact with the backend API. Standard JWT validation prevents token tampering or misuse.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Requests to protected API endpoints (e.g., /users/me) without a valid Bearer token are rejected with HTTP status 401 Unauthorized.
  - Requests with an invalid/expired/tampered token are rejected with HTTP status 401 Unauthorized.
  - Requests with a valid token are passed to the next layer (Authorization).
  - The backend correctly configures validation parameters (Auth0 domain/issuer, API audience).
  - The OAS documentation accurately reflects the Bearer token security scheme for protected endpoints.
-
- **Priority:** Must Have
- **Standard/Reference:** JWT RFC 7519, OWASP A01:2021-Broken Access Control, OAS 3.x (Security Schemes)

**REQ-AUTH-003**

- **Requirement Type:** Security, Auditing
- **Description:** Successful and failed user login attempts MUST be logged for auditing purposes. Log entries MUST include User ID (if available), Timestamp (UTC), Source IP Address, User Agent, and Attempt Outcome (Success/Failure reason).
- **Rationale:** Provides a security trail for tracking account access and identifying potential malicious activity like brute-forcing.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Audit logs capture successful logins via Auth0 callback/token validation.
  - Audit logs capture failed login attempts reported by Auth0 (if possible via webhooks/logs) or inferred from failed token validation.
  - Log entries contain all specified fields.
-
- **Priority:** Must Have
- **Standard/Reference:** OWASP A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**REQ-AUTH-004**

- **Requirement Type:** Security, Functional, API
- **Description:** The system MUST provide a secure logout mechanism. An API endpoint (e.g., POST /v1/auth/logout) MUST be provided. On the client, logout MUST clear locally stored authentication tokens. The backend API call SHOULD trigger Auth0 session revocation (if applicable/configured) and MUST invalidate any server-side session state tied to the access token (if any).
- **Rationale:** Ensures user sessions are properly terminated.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Client logout action clears tokens.
  - POST /v1/auth/logout endpoint exists and performs necessary cleanup/revocation.
  - Subsequent API calls using the old token are rejected.
  - The endpoint is documented in the OAS specification.

- **Priority:** Must Have
